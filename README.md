# wssha256-kmod
Linux loadable kernel module supporting the wssha256 hardware accelerator, complete with userspace API and test programs. THe wssha256 hardware accelerator targets the Xilinx Zynq7000 running the linux-xlnx kernel. This repository can be built on its own on an x86 host system or natively on the Zynq (if you are insane), however it is designed to be integrated into a custom image built with the Yocto Linux build system. The Yocto layer that incorporates the software provided in this
repository can be found at [meta-wscryptohw](https://github.com/bigbrett/meta-wscryptohw "meta-wscryptohw")
